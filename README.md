## Setting up the project

### What you'll need

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [Intellij WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (LTS)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Connecting to the backend

Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env` with:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Contributions

### Working with GraphQL

We are utilizing GraphQL fragments, recommended with [Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen), to keep our data, types and components close together. This allows for stricter typing when fetching data, with [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react), in our components.

_Generate graphql types after adding or updating a query_

- `pnpm generate`

> **_NOTE:_** We are still exploring advanced features of GraphQL and Apollo Client to enhance efficiency.

### Commit Message Convention

This project is using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), it is mandatory to use it to commit changes.

## Tests

```sh
pnpm cypress install # if you dont have cypress installed
pnpm cy:open
```

## Deployment

The site is deployed at https://slicktelemetry.com using Vercel.

## Project Structure

We are...

- Using NextJs [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)
- Hosting on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Monitoring with [Posthog](https://posthog.com/)
- Designing in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/4OauoAtraVKgcJaeYB6Qjq/Dashboard-Trial?node-id=0-1&t=WlqH6kA06RgqCWcy-1)
